# pyenv
#   For a library or package, you might want to ignore these files since the code is intended to run in multiple environments; however, for an application, they can be very useful.
# .python-version

# pipenv
#   According to pypa/pipenv#598, it is recommended to include Pipfile.lock in version control.
#   However, in case of collaboration, if having merge conflicts you can easily regenerate it.
Pipfile.lock

# poetry
#   Similar to Pipfile.lock, it is generally included in version control.
#   Uncomment if you have an established project and want to prevent overriding changes by collaborators.
# poetry.lock
